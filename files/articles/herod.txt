<person>Herod</person> (<person>/herod/</person>; Modern: Hordos, 74/73 BCE – c. 4 BCE),[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] also known as <person>Herod</person> the Great and <person>Herod</person> I, was a Roman client king of Judea,[10][11][12] referred to as the Herodian kingdom. The history of his legacy has polarized opinion, as he is known for his colossal building projects throughout Judea, including his renovation of the Second Temple in Jerusalem and the expansion of the Temple Mount towards its north,[13] the construction of the port at Caesarea Maritima, the fortress at Masada, and Herodium. Vital details of his life are recorded in the works of the 1st century CE Roman–Jewish historian Josephus.[14] <person>Herod</person> also appears in the Christian Gospel of Matthew as the ruler of Judea who orders the Massacre of the Innocents at the time of the birth of Jesus, although a majority of <person>Herod</person> biographers and biblical scholars hold this to be false.[15] Despite his successes, including singlehandedly forging a new aristocracy from practically nothing,[16] he has still garnered criticism from various historians. His reign polarizes opinion amongst scholars and historians, some viewing his legacy as evidence of success, and some as a reminder of his tyrannical rule.[14]
